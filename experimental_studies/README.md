# PyQt5 Desktop Application

An experimental desktop application was developed using PyQt5 to provide a user-friendly interface for the ComfyUI workflow. The applicationâ€™s primary goals include:

- **Launching a ComfyUI server in the background**
- **Presenting a simplified interface for end-users**
- **Managing all ComfyUI operations seamlessly**

This development effort resulted in significant progress, though not all planned features were completed at the time of project conclusion. Below is a summary of both the fully implemented features and the features still under development.

## Completed Features
- **ComfyUI Server Integration:** The application successfully launches and manages a ComfyUI server instance in the background without requiring direct user intervention.
- **User Interface Design:** A basic but functional interface was developed, allowing users to interact with key ComfyUI functionalities in an intuitive manner.
- **Task Queue Management:** All user actions are queued for sequential processing, ensuring orderly execution of tasks.
- **Task Status Tracking:** Completed tasks are marked as "Completed" in the queue but remain in the list for user reference.
- **Cancel Options:** Users can cancel individual tasks in the queue or choose to cancel all queued tasks at once.
- **Task Clearing:** A "Clear All Tasks" option allows users to remove all tasks from the queue with a single action.
- **Dark Mode & Light Mode Support:** The application supports both dark mode and light mode, allowing users to switch between themes as needed.
- **Progress Bar for Queue Items:** Each queued task is displayed with an associated progress bar, giving real-time feedback on task execution.
- **Task Preview on Double-Click:** Double-clicking a task in the queue brings it to the main screen for detailed view and interaction.

## Ongoing Development
- **Custom Output Management:** A feature to allow users to define custom output paths and formats for completed tasks is under development.
- **Output Image Preview:** The ability to display the output image directly within the application is currently being implemented.
- **Enhanced Error Management:** Improvements are being made to handle a wider range of errors with more robust and detailed reporting.
- **Full ComfyUI Integration:** Efforts are ongoing to achieve complete integration with ComfyUI, allowing the desktop application to support all advanced workflows and functionalities offered by ComfyUI.
